# Final_Intigrated_Website!

Welcome to the Origin Makerspace!

A make believe centre for imaginative minds to realize their creativity.

This site will provide contact to staff (so far just myself (Josh Taylor)) and hopfully help answer any questions you might have such as hours of operation, membership information, and specs on available equipment.

Also the site is a place where the comunity can share their creations, to inspire, and gain insperation 
for new projects.
